Maybe publish the decks online?

```
!card Island
```

looks up card info


```
add to deck
add 1 to deck
add 40 to deck island.dec
```

adds/remove to (defaulting to most recent) deck for user, creating new one if none

```
hands with 3 lands
hands with 3 lands by turn 1, 2, 3
hands with 3 lands and counterspell by turn 3
```

simulation and/or calculation of percentages.

do we want to also support custom mulligan rules?

```

```

as you'd expect.

```
mana curve
mana curve for island.deck
```
